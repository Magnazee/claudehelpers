Claude Helpers Project
====================

This repository contains scripts and utilities designed for use by LLM agents (like Claude) to perform various operations through command-line interfaces. The scripts handle environment setup, credential management, and provide consistent interfaces to various tools.

Available Tools
-------------
1. GitHub Operations (./bin/github)
   - Repository management
   - Issue tracking
   - Pull requests
   - Any GitHub CLI operation

2. TerminusDB Operations (./bin/terminusdb)
   - Knowledge unit management
   - Database operations
   - Query execution

Usage Instructions
----------------
1. Always use the update-repo script first to ensure latest version:
   ./bin/update-repo

2. Tools follow a consistent pattern:
   ./bin/<domain> <command> [options]

3. Each tool handles its own prerequisites and credentials via env.sh

Update Policy
------------
- Repository must be updated if changes are available
- This prompt file must be re-read after any updates
- Local modifications must be handled before updates

Environment Setup
---------------
1. Copy env.template.sh to env.sh
2. Configure required credentials in env.sh
3. Run tool-specific setup if needed (e.g., './bin/github setup')

Error Handling
------------
- Clear error messages indicate required actions
- Credential errors suggest env.sh updates
- Tool missing errors provide installation instructions
